# Hypothesis testing of a pay gap in a Spark Fortress Inc.
## Project Objective
This Data Science project aims to determine whether a pay gap exists in Spark Fortress Company based on gender and ethnicity, using hypothesis testing.

## Data used
- <a href = "https://github.com/pagonzales/Data_Science_Project_Hypothesis_Testing_Gender_Pay_gap/blob/main/Data%20set.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions
- Does a gender pay gap exist across all age groups in the company?
- Does a gender pay gap exist between employees aged 35 and below and those above 35?
- Does a pay gap exist with respect to employeesâ€™ ethnicity?
## Process
- First standardize the given raw data.
- Find the necessary statistical parameters (sample number, mean, population variance, pooled variance, t-score, and p-value).
- Use the commands in MS Excel like nested functions to find these statistical parameters from a given data set.
- Analyze the resulting p-values from a different categories(gender pay gap and ethnicity) in different significance level (10%,5%,1%)
- Finally, give an insight about the results.
